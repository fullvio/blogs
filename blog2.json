The challenge was significant: they lacked the ability/capacity to develop a tool that could accurately calculate and reduce carbon emissions produced by both businesses and individuals in their daily activities—ranging from heating and driving to general lifestyle choices. Their goal was to create a user-friendly tool that could calculate carbon footprints, helping users become more environmentally responsible."

        "content": "Fullvio stepped in with a tailored AI-driven solution. We developed a unique chat-bot capable of calculating the carbon footprint for both businesses and households. The tool was designed to integrate various aspects such as transportation, heating, or water usage into a single, comprehensive calculation. This holistic approach ensured that the client could offer their customers a thorough and user-friendly experience. Additionally, the chat-bot was equipped with a solution-proposal feature, offering users specific ways to reduce their carbon footprint after the calculation. The implementation was streamlined and efficient. Fullvio integrated the tool directly onto the client’s website, completing the entire process within a month. Despite the complexity of the project, effective communication between the client and Fullvio ensured that the tool was perfectly aligned with the client’s industry expertise and specific needs."
